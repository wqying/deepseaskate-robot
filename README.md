# Neurorobotics of the Deep: Deep Sea Skate #
## Overview ##
This repository contains code for the final project for my COGS 112R: Cognitive Robotics class. The goal of the final project is to build a biomimetic agent using Lego Spike Prime sets with implementation of cognitive robotics techniques. This is a group project. Group members: Qian Ying Wong, Ethan Masiclat, Ramiyah Dougherty.

## Directories ##
**Data**: Contains a csv file and a .py file for data handling. These data are taken from the robot's logs when running trials.

**FinalReport**: Contains a pdf report of the project as well as plots describing our Q-learning implementation. There is also a complementary image of our robot in its environment.

**Plotting**: Contains Python code (using Matplotlib) for plotting the graphs in FinalReport.

**src**: Contains a .llsp3 file and a .py file that has the exact same contents. The .py file was created for readability purposes.

### In src: The Main Implementation Code ###
Code was written in Lego Spike Prime's built in Python environment that contains the necessary Lego Robotics modules and packages, such as hub, color_sensor, motor_pair, light_matrix, and others. 

## The Robot ##
The robot is built using Lego parts and Lego Spike Prime's hub, motor, color sensors, and other various parts from the robotics kit provided by the professor.
