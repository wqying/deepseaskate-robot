## Neurorobotics of the Deep: Deep Sea Skate ##
### Overview ###
This repository contains code for the final project for my COGS 112R: Cognitive Robotics class. The goal of the final project is to build a biomimetic agent using Lego Spike Prime sets with implementation of cognitive robotics techniques. This is a group project.

### About the Code ###
Code was written in Lego Spike Prime's built in Python environment that contains the necessary Lego Robotics modules and packages. This repository has two different file types with the same code content: .llsp3 and .py. The .py file is a direct copy and paste of the contents from the .llsp3 file for readability purposes.

### About the Hardware ###
The robot is built using Lego parts and Lego Spike Prime's hub, motor, color sensors, and other various parts from the robotics kit provided by the professor.
